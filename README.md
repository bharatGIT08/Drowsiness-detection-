# Drowsiness-detection-
Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. It tracks eye movements using a 68-point facial landmark model and triggers an alarm when drowsiness is detected based on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). Integrated live webcam feed for continuous real-time monitoring.
